# Jellyfin app for Roku

Disclaimer: This is a proof of concept for my own ability to learn and write
BrightScript, and not yet intended to be a fully functional Roku app.


### Images

With ImageMagick installed
```
sh make_images.sh
```

This will regenerate the poster and splash images from the jellyfin-ux repo.
